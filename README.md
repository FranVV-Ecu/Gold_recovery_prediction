# Gold_recovery_prediction
Model of gold recovery prediction for metallurgy refinery 


## Project Description
Preparing a prototype of a machine learning model for Digitala. The company develops solutions for efficient operation of industrial enterprises.

The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore. You have data with mining and refining parameters at your disposal.

The model will help to optimize production so that you don't run a plant with unprofitable characteristics.

Need:

Prepare the data;
Conduct exploratory analysis of the data;
Build and train the model.
